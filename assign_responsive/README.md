# assign_responsive
An example HTML file of data to be styled responsively using Bootstrap

Rikki Kendall's README file for this Page Responsiveness project. Implementing Bootstrap was definitely an extremely interesting task.

I started with trying to make different columns work in the HTML code with lifeandsciences.html and with the second html file named lifeandsciences.html I merely changed the background color with different screen sizes. I felt it was appropriate that way.
