	<p>Ever needed a study group for a tough course but don’t have any friends?
  Here is your solution: study group matching. You just register in our
  database of many other friends also eager to study with you. Create an open
  chat room for people to join, and you’ll enter in your class name, professor,
  desired group size, and some information about yourself. Then other people
  would read through the current existing chat rooms and join your group.
	Group matching does not have to be exclusive to academics. It could also
  include getting together for a certain cause, debate about a specific topic,
  or even hanging out on a lonely Friday night. Sometimes just getting together
  and talking through different ideas and perspectives helps a lot for
  understanding topics.</p>

	<p>Other uses of the application includes matching you with someone who has
  taken your course and can help you in return for you to help them in one
  of their courses. It is like a win-win for both sides and both of you
  benefit from it. You provide your help and they provide theirs. Sometimes
  we just need a database that can find these resources for us, especially
  in such a big community like Duke.</p>

	<p>This project would be appropriately sized because it has a similar form
  to Trello, only the workspace is shared between all users not unique to
  individuals. They will create a group, or a “list”, that people can join
  in. Also, this concept is intriguing as it’s something we can use in our
  everyday lives -- not only simply for our course final project but we can
  utilize it in the future too.</p>

	<p>Possible data sources this project may use are: Firebase for creating user
  accounts and data storage, javascript for user-input , and Vue.js for UX.</p>
