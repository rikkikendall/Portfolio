# assign_game

A simple example of a game in JavaScript

An interesting assignment in Javascript, by far the most difficult for me just due to the fact that I needed to learn an entirely new coding language. 

I had some trouble uploading the assignment as the Link to my Index.html page did not seem to work properly so I kept trying to update the game.html file in order for the Game to work. However, I am unsure of how to debug this situation. I also do not want to be counted late for my attempts to try to make it better. I watched the code work properly once, however, not after all of the files were uploaded.
