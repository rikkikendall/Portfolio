# lab-node

This project uses the Vue init template "webpack-simple" which configures the package dependencies and folder structure.
It uses Vue single file components in a ".vue" file format that must be compiled into standard JavaScript.
It also includes Bootstrap to show how that would be done.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies (only required after changing package.json file)
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
