This Interactive Image Gallery assignment was difficult, I have to admit. 
I needed help from every resource I could find, whether that was online or in person during Office Hours. 
Ultimately, I had to teach myself quickly on how JSON files worked with Javascript and the ways in which
you can manipulate them for your code. I had trouble linking the files but once the images showed up I 
began playing with the code until the deadline when I submitted what I have here. 

I have two options: Japan and Cuba photos and the checkboxes work to sort them. An enlarged image pops up 
when the user clicks on a desired image with a caption at the bottom. I put the code through validation 
checkers and they should be all good.
