            Welcome to my hobby website, Go Duke! I love Duke Basketball and Bridges! 
        </p>
                    <p>
I would like to take this moment to reflect upon the time I tented out in K-Ville for one game, a truly incredible game. I intended to Black Tent my freshman year but we instead fell short in the Duke Basketball Trivia and were not able to get a spot in the first 70 tents. This was devestating so we took the necessary steps to receive a spot in the next 30 white tenting spots by being the second group to find the secret spot. In the end, we were able to get third row for the Duke game and I merely had to tent a couple times in the day and a couple nights. In a way, I was glad that we didn't make the first 70 tents but also sad because I will never be able to tent again. For today, I am a Line Monitor, one of those that are hated by the tenters who are woken up in the middle of the night for a check.
