            Welcome to my website, I'd like to introduce myself my name is Rikki and I am from Sasebo, Japan. I am in the Class of 2020 here at Duke University.

                <h3>Computer Autobiography</h3> 

            <p>
I would like to take this moment to reflect upon my goals for this class and the reason why I have chosen to study the art of programming and website development. 
        </p>
<p> I began using a computer when I was in kindergarten just after my dad removed me from a Japanese kindergarten. At the time, I was unable to speak to my own father at the dinner table and communication was extremely tough between father and son. He thought that was unacceptable so I was thrown into the US Military High School on the US Naval Base I lived on where I continued English as a Second Language classes until my English improved.  </p>
<p> For most of my time with computers, I frequently used Dell computers operating on Windows operating systems. This was mainly because the government-issued computers on the base were mainly the same old Dell Desktop computers that had a secured connection. However, once I got to college I switched over to an Apple Macbook Pro.
</p>
<p> I utilize computers on a daily basis for research in some of my classes as well as for the programming classes I am currently taking. 
        </p>
<p> What computer scientists do on a daily basis is a tough question to find a clear and exact answer for due to the broad scope that computer scientists can apply their skills to today. However, I believe the most important thing that computer scientists tend to use their valuable skills for is utilizing modern technology to solve everyday problems or make our life easier. Programmers can find ways to develop software and mobile applications that can get us from one place to another (Lyft), or communicate with one another via social media. The computer scienctisits I have been facinated with are those that apply their skills to mechanical problems such as computers in cars and vehicles. </p>
 <p>The events that made me more interested in computer science may be slightly different than others. I was never interested in sitting behind a computer screen programming applications and software for daily job. I was more interested in the car business and more engineering related careers growing up. However, after I joined Duke Motorsports and went to Michigan to talk with many car industries and automobile companies, it seemed that they were looking for more computer/ECE related people than the traditional mechanical engineer. I found that super interesting and wanted to change my course towards computer science and it has been extremely interesting ever since. </p>
<p> The skills required to code different parts of a website include basic HTML skills or programming languages and a taste for art. I believe that what makes a website appealing is not just its accessibility and usability but also its artistic appeal and whether it is attractive to the user. I believe a certain amount of taste and creativity is important in coding different parts of a website on top of the programming skills needed to code a proper website. 
        </p>
<p> I see myself using computers in the future in a variety of ways. My first step is to join the US Air Force after graduating Duke so I intend to utilize the programming skills I have obtained from my Duke Education to apply it as an Intelligence Officer or Cyber Officer in the Air Force. A career after the Air Force is still very far down the line but I hope to be involved in the automobile industry or aeronautical industry utilizing the experience I gained from the Air Force to a job in the civlian realm.
