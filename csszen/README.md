This assignment is for the CSS ZEN PROJECT and all files included in this folder are for submission. These files include: 
2 index.html files
2 style.css files
In this assignment, we were asked to go to the CSS Zen Project website and download their index.html file and style.css file.
We then made no changes to the html file except to link to the correct style.css file for that page. Next, the style.css file
was altered to change the design of the index.html page without touching the html code at all. It was a very interesting and
fun assignment and thanks for reading this!
